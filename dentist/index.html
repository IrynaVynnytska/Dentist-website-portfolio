                <p class="description">A dental cleaning, also known as prophylaxis, involves the removal of plaque, tartar, and stains from your teeth. The dentist or dental hygienist will use special tools to clean your teeth, followed by polishing to make them smooth and shiny. This routine preventive procedure helps maintain oral hygiene and prevents gum disease.</p>

                <p class="description">Dental fillings are used to repair teeth that have been damaged by decay or cavities. The dentist will remove the decayed portion of the tooth and fill the space with a suitable material, such as composite resin, amalgam, or porcelain. Fillings restore the tooth's structure, prevent further decay, and improve its function.</p>

                <p class="description">Teeth whitening, also known as teeth bleaching, is a cosmetic procedure that lightens the color of your teeth, removing stains and discoloration. The dentist may use a bleaching gel and a specialized light source to activate the gel, resulting in brighter and whiter teeth. This procedure helps enhance your smile and boost your confidence.</p>

                <p class="description">A dental crown is a cap-like restoration that covers a damaged or decayed tooth entirely. It is custom-made to match the shape, size, and color of your natural teeth. Crowns are used to restore the strength, functionality, and appearance of a tooth that has undergone extensive decay, undergone a root canal, or has been fractured. They provide protection and improve the tooth's aesthetics.</p>
